        <h1>Hello!</h1>
        <p>
          I am a software developer specializing in full-stack web applications.
          <br />
          My go-to tools are React, Node, Express, and Python. <br />
          <br />
          I'm passionate about continually learning and exploring new ways to
          solve problems, big and small
          <br />
          <br />
          My seven years of experience in sales and partnership management
          roles, analytical nature, and passion for problem solving make me a
          great fit for a team looking to build products that delight customers
          and partners alike.
          <br />
          <br />
          I am open to full-time, remote dev positions at startups backed by
          top-tier investors.
